Project 2: Registration of different MRI modalities

To run the code, simply clone the repository, open Matlab, select the folder and "add to path -> add folder and subfolders".
Then code.m can be run. As is, it allows to test poinset registration. To test another section, simply remove the %{ ... %} surrounding it.
